Uber's purported impact on SF's DUI reports

Based on the data provided for incidents between 2003 and 2013, the pivot tables required for analysys looks as follows:

If it were true that Uber’s launch in San Francisco in June 2010 had a noticeable impact on DUI reports, then we would expect to see a constant decrease in DUI’s after the launch date.

As the data shows, there isn’t a significant nor continuous drop on this stat. Additionally, we notice an important increase in pedestrian drunkenness, an statistic that might not be related to Uber’s launch, but if so, it might point out to a greater amount of people willing to go out / get inebriated, but not willing to drive afterwards. Again, this might not be related to Uber, and more data is needed.
